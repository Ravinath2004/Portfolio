        In this assignment, I have written an extensive review about two apps with different purposes I have chosen such as for entertainment, give information, for navigation, etc. I have explained the features and intended use of each app.
Then, I review how the features of the two apps affect the intended use, usability and appeal to the target audience.
Finally, I discuss at least one strength and one weakness for at least one of the mobile apps.

        In this assignment, I have comprehensively designed and developed a multifunctional quiz app. It includes a title screen, at least five quiz questions, images, sounds, a scoring system, and user feedback. Iâ€™ve also optimized assets and maintained clear, well-commented code.
