        In this assignment, I have written an extensive review about two apps with different purposes I have chosen such as for entertainment, give information, for navigation, etc. I have explained the features and intended use of each app.
Then, I review how the features of the two apps affect the intended use, usability and appeal to the target audience.
Finally, I discuss at least one strength and one weakness for at least one of the mobile apps.

        In this assignment, I have comprehensively designed and developed a multifunctional quiz app. It includes a title screen, at least five quiz questions, images, sounds, a scoring system, and user feedback. Iâ€™ve also optimized assets and maintained clear, well-commented code.

      This is the design I have created for an app that I was assigned in the Mobile App Development assignment. This app design I have created is about the long lasting rivalry between the famout football players Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. This quiz has a a title/start screen, at least 5 quiz questions, use of images and sounds, a method of letting the user know if they have the right or wrong answer, a scoring system. I have also included an asset list and a data dictionary for the design as well as some alternative design pages at the bottom.
